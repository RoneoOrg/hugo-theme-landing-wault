Unfortunately, there is no standard password database format. Each password manager uses its own format. 
At any rate, almost all of them support CSV. At first glance, that sounds fine, but CSV files are not specialized 
password database formats, they only define the low-level structure of the stored data.

Besides, CSV can only describe table data, while Wault cards are extremely flexible
(you can add as many fields as you want) and your set of cards cannot be reduced to a simple table.

> Note that an unencrypted CSV file will never leave your computer. The process
> of import takes place right in your browser.

Many password managers enable you to export into a CSV file (among them: Keepass, Lastpass, 1password, 
Passpack, PasswordPlus). Wault simplifies import of these CSV files to your Wault account.

Go to Import menu and choose CSV option:

- click "Open CSV file" and select the CSV file on your computer;
- click "Next" and follow the instructions.
