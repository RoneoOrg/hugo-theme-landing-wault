being online can make you feel uneasy. That's why we've included the autonomous copying from the very first version."

An offline copy allows you to save all the encrypted contents of your account to a local hard drive or email and 
create a portable, read-only version of Wault to use when you are not connected to the Internet.

Your offline copy is just a single HTML file that contains both the entire Wault and your encrypted data. 
It is just as secure and doesn't put your data at risk because the offline application uses the same security architecture.

## Download the autonomous copy
- choose «Export» in the side menu;
- click «Download a copy»;
- browser will download the file with the name wault_date.html.

> Using an offline copy should not be confused with launching Wault from a local file, which allows
> to launch the local code for reading/recording of the encrypted data from/to the Wault server.

To access a previously saved offline copy, simply open the downloaded HTML file in any browser
and log in with your Wault password.
