As passwords are the most common type of personal information that you need to protect,
we have added many features to make Wault a great online password manager, thus solving the problem 
of "weak passwords." The main features of Wault:

- full end-to-end[^1] data encryption on the client;
- authentication without password transmission ([SRP]({{< relref "/security/srp" >}}));
- [offline copy]({{< relref "/features/offline" >}}) when you don't have access to the Internet;
- [import]({{< relref "/features/import" >}}) and export, because it's your data;
- mobile version, convenient web-version for your smartphone;
- one-time passwords for secure access from unprotected devices.

## Anonymity
Wault is fully anonymous. No personal information or email address is required to create a 
Wault account. Simply select a username and password.

## Zero Maintenance
Since your data is stored online, you don't have to install, update, or maintain anything.
You can access your most valuable data from anywhere, anytime.

## Open source code
> Wault makes the Internet the most convenient and safe place for storage of your most valuable
> and confidential data.

Wault has [open source code]({{< relref "/source" >}}). We want all concerned people to invest in 
developing their own safety and security of the community. So, you can fully trust Wault, its code 
base, not its developers.
