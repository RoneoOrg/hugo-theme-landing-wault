linkTitle: "Privacy"
aux: "Wault does not collect, store, or process your personal information.
This is our privacy policy in a nutshell."
---

Wault does not require visitors or users to provide personal information,
such as names, email addresses, and phone numbers.

## Account data

- when you create an account, we simply ask you to choose a username and password.
  However, because of the authentication protocol we use [SRP]({{< relref "/security/srp">}}) Wault doesn't store 
  either your username or your password;
- when paid subscriptions are launched, new accounts will expire after the trial period.

## Feedback

If you voluntarily provide Wault with personal information via email or any other communication channel (github), 
we will retain contact information to keep communication flowing. As an example: if you email us or create 
a ticket, your name and email address will be included in our contact list. We reserve the right to contact you 
through these same channels to notify you of service updates and other needs.

However, data that you have encrypted with your password manager and Wault digital storage can't be associated 
with your name, email address, or any other personal information.

## Cookie files

When you visit the main Wault website, we send one or more cookies to your computer that can uniquely identify 
your browser. We use cookies to improve the quality of the website by storing user preferences and tracking user 
trends (e.g. Google Analytics).

When you sign in to Wault's cloud-based password management application, we send a single cookie to your browser 
to authorize your SRP session.

## Server Logs

Wault servers track each visit to each web page. The log entry may contain information, normally found in the 
"header" of your web browser request, such as the type of browser you use, your Internet protocol address, and the 
date and time of day. This log information is important for security, auditing, quality improvement, and for 
monitoring the performance of our service.

## Anonymity

It is now clear that Wault knows very little about you. Ideally, we would like to know nothing. Therefore, we urge 
you to take any measures to achieve this goal (for example: you can access Wault using anonymization tools such as VPN).

However, we will never share collected information with third parties outside of Wault, even in the form of aggregated 
non-personal data.

## Harsh reality

We know next to nothing about the identity of the users and absolutely nothing about the encrypted data you store 
in Wault. Most importantly, we can't find your specific data among the entire set of encrypted records stored on our 
servers. We even ignore the username you choose.

On the other hand, we are certainly willing to comply with any applicable laws, regulations, lawsuits, or requirements 
of governments and other authorities that are enforceable. However, we may provide authorized parties with only a dump 
of the encrypted Wault database, which is effectively useless.
